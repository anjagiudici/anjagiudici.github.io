We intervene in this debate by showing that stratification in secondary schooling is multidimensional. The extent of differentiation into separate tracks is distinct from hierarchy between tracks. To address data limitations in existing research, we collect novel data on education policies from 1945 onwards for 16 European countries. Combined with mobility data from the European Social Survey we use a difference-in-difference regression model to test the effects of hierarchy and differentiation on intergenerational mobility. Hierarchical stratification shapes the inheritance of educational attainment while differentiation does not. Differentiation only reduces mobility where educational pathways are hierarchically structured. These findings imply that studies using measures of differentiation (e.g. the tracking age), may instead be picking up aspects of hierarchy. They therefore highlight the importance for future research to measure multiple dimensions of stratification and assessing how combinations of policies can reinforce or undermine one another.","tags":null,"title":"Multidimensionality Matters: The Implications of Educational Hierarchy and Differentiation for Intergenerational Mobility in Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jane Gingrich","Anja Giudici","Daniel McArthur"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675209600,"objectID":"daf5ba469a6f7838c2a3d3b76dce66ea","permalink":"https://anjagiudici.github.io/publication/gingrichetal2022/","publishdate":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gingrichetal2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In the post-war period, the focus of governments in advanced democracies generally shifted from generalising basic education to staffing an increasing share of the population with more complex and specialised knowledge and skills through the expansion of secondary schooling.

The affirmation of the principle that each state should represent a national collective in the nineteenth century, turned schools into powerful means to legitimate institutional power by disseminating national identities and crafting national collectives. Since then, nationalism has re-shaped the curriculum across the globe. An accurate understanding of this phenomenon is therefore crucial for curriculum scholars.\nThe understanding of the concept of nation and all its related terms is the object of a dedicated field of research characterized by lively debate. This chapter aims to provide a map for curriculum researchers to identify the most useful concepts, as well as to reflect on their methodological and theoretical consequences, benefits, and risks. Drawing on an extensive literature review, it identifies three approaches to nationalism in curriculum research: the ideal norm approach, the typological approach, and the claim-based approach.\nThe chapter argues that elite-based approaches building on nationalism as a global norm or ideal type risk over-emphasizing the extent and homogeneity of the impact of nationalism on the curriculum. By putting the process of curriculum-making at the center of the analysis, and focusing on its protagonists’ own understanding and prioritization of nationalism, claim-based approaches take into account recent critiques of the methodological statism and nationalism advanced in both nationalism and curriculum research. They therefore can significantly advance our theorizing of the relationship between nationalism and the curriculum, and help us to identify how, when, and under which conditions nationalism contributes to shaping the curriculum – and when it does not.","tags":null,"title":"Nationalism and the Curriculum: Analytical and Methodological Considerations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anja Giudici","Patrick Emmenegger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658534400,"objectID":"0e9af8aa778273b844c8f56dafed6d6b","permalink":"https://anjagiudici.github.io/publication/giudiciemmenegger2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giudiciemmenegger2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In German.\nThis chapter outlines the main characteristics of Swiss education politics and policy from both comparative and historical perspectives.","tags":null,"title":"Bildungspolitik","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652745600,"objectID":"97bbfb45784d019b2da494607511e580","permalink":"https://anjagiudici.github.io/outreach/giudici2022/","publishdate":"2022-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreach/giudici2022/","section":"outreach","summary":"Blogpost on the radical right as an educational actor for [bildungsgeschichte.de](https://bildungsgeschichte.de/beitrag/2341).","tags":null,"title":"Bildungshistorische Perspektiven auf den Aufstieg der westeuropäischen radikalen Rechten","type":"outreach"},{"authors":["Anja Giudici"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1632096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632096000,"objectID":"eef64239fcf0e603e913c9d2d3246c70","permalink":"https://anjagiudici.github.io/publication/giudici2020fr/","publishdate":"2021-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giudici2020fr/","section":"publication","summary":"Since the 1980s, right-wing extremism, radicalism, and populism have emerged as transformative forces in European politics. This unexpected resurgence has triggered an interdisciplinary scholarly effort to refine our understanding of the far right. Educationalists, however, have largely been absent from this endeavour, leaving us unable to theorise and address the potential effects of the far right’s political and cultural growth on European education. This article aims to provide an empirically based conceptional groundwork for educational research on the far right. Drawing on archival research and content analysis of programmatic material produced by diverse and influential far-right organisations in France, (West) Germany, and Italy, I show that the post-war European far right disposes of the two essential features of a social movement: an action-oriented frame that reduces educational reforms to a common contentious theme, and a dense organisational network. The latter engages in institutional and contentious politics, as well as education. Theoretically, these findings suggest that, in the realm of education, the far right ought to be conceptualised as a social movement that seeks to influence education policy, and represents itself an educational actor. Addressing the far right’s multifaceted educational engagement thus requires a combined effort across European education research.","tags":null,"title":"Seeds of authoritarian opposition: Far-right education politics in post-war Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Based on the large-scale data collection I contributed to as part of the Schoolpol Project (https://schoolpol.web.ox.ac.uk/home), I am investigating the determinants of post-WW II education reform in Western democracies.

Studies of these inter-connections typically ask whether and how the generation of official policy from the top-down affects micro-politics, i.e. how teachers experience and execute their work. The assumption that policy is influenced in the reverse direction is widely held, but has seldom been studied empirically. Little is known, therefore, about how this dynamic operates. This study delineates mechanisms that link teachers’ micro-politics to the macro-politics of policy generation. Analytically, it combines concepts from the literature on teacher involvement in macro- and micro-politics in order to develop a framework bridging the two. Empirically, it harnesses the theoretical potential of Swiss language education policy, tracing the process of reforms through which teachers, though formally excluded from policy-making, were able to influence the choice of languages included in official curricula. The analysis identifies three mechanisms through which they exerted influence: voicing experience, subversive enactment, and open resistance. None of these are dependent upon higher levels of teacher unionisation or particular institutions of governance. These findings highlight the importance of engaging with the processual dimension of politics to advance our theories of educational policy.","tags":null,"title":"Teacher politics bottom-up: theorising the impact of micro-politics on policy generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anja Giudici"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"c3e0a10a494ca9bb7c195b50ebbd29a5","permalink":"https://anjagiudici.github.io/publication/giudici2020ing/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giudici2020ing/","section":"publication","summary":"In Italian.\n\nThe book analyse historical and current developments in Swiss language policy, discussing their implications for the European context.","tags":null,"title":"Il plurilinguismo svizzero e la sfida dell'inglese.

So far, research has not remarked upon the extraordinarily strong involvement of educators in these groups. Exploiting Switzerland’s particular situation in this period, this paper aims to shed new light on the relationship between authoritarian politics and education. To this end, we analyse the educational writings by activists of the main Swiss fascist organisation Nationale Front (NF), between 1933 and 1938, asking what role they attributed schooling in bringing their societal vision about, as well as which reforms they proposed for schooling to conform to this role. We argue that Swiss interwar-fascists considered schooling a conservative institution that could not contribute to producing an authoritarian revolution, but had to be reformed thereafter. However, despite sharing a unified vision of the future fascist Volksgemeinschaft, NF activists did not agree on what kind of schools were needed to educate it. Swiss fascists never even came close to attaining the position of power needed to execute their ideas, and thus were never burdened by practical or institutional difficulties of government. Consequently, these results suggest that, despite its totalitarian aspiration, interwar European authoritarianism did not come with a clear educational vision.","tags":null,"title":"How to educate an authoritarian society: conflicting views on school reform for a fascist society in interwar Switzerland","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This ongoing project is financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant nr. 184086, 2019-2020).\nEducation and politics are closely connected. Education is always directed at, and constituted by, specific societal and political purposes. Vice-versa, every societal and political project needs to con- sider how to mould the individuals and the society that will sustain it. After World War II, a broad consensus emerged in the Western world that education and schooling should serve to consolidate liberal democracy. Education reforms in this period aimed to mitigate societal inequality, prevent children from developing illiberal and authoritarian attitudes, and teach them the benefits and morality of political participation. However, liberal democracy as a political ideal is being increasingly contested – especially by representatives of the far right-wing of the political spectrum. In the last few decades, far-right parties and intellectuals have moved from fringe status to mainstream players in electoral politics and the societal debate.\nThe far right’s visions of society and politics are fundamentally at odds with liberal-democratic fundamental values such as pluralism, equality, and individual rights, which have underpinned educational thinking and policy since 1945. Does that therefore mean the education systems the movement envisions is also fundamentally different from what we have seen so far? If education is to be conceived of as the “twin-sister of democratic theory” (Honneth, 2012) how do the twin-sisters of undemocratic postwar-fascism and populist-nativist-authoritarianism look? Do they have a specific look at all?\nThis project represents the first empirically-based analysis of the educational of the western European postwar far right’s educational ideas and politics. Its focus is twofold. First, it investigates how this movement wants to see formal education governed and structured, as well as what content it believes education should convey. Second, it studies how the movement has engaged in educational politics, thus identifying strategic and organisational choices in this particular policy field. The project involves multi-archive research, and analysis of programmatic documents produced by what are deemed the most influential organisations of the western European postwar radical right from the 1950s to the 2000s. This includes parties and think tanks in France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K.\nThe project will provide a novel interdisciplinary theoretical contribution to education, as well as to political science and history. On the one hand, it complements it complements social scientists’ understanding on the ideology and strategies of the postwar radical right. On the other hand, it yields new insights into the relationship between political and educational ideals, allowing us to reflect on what actually characterises education in liberal and democratic terms.\n","date":1569024000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569024000,"objectID":"ba4441bf9075b09e2e95eb6cfa64baae","permalink":"https://anjagiudici.github.io/project/eduvsdemo/","publishdate":"2019-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/eduvsdemo/","section":"project","summary":"The education policy and policy of the far right","tags":null,"title":"Education against (liberal) democracy","type":"project"},{"authors":["Anja Giudici","Thomas Ruoss","Giorgia Masoni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569024000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569024000,"objectID":"4b1d6cb4e9fdfb502af2aaa4842aa123","permalink":"https://anjagiudici.github.io/publication/giudiciruossmasoni2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giudiciruossmasoni2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Progressive education is generally thought to bear little commonality with authoritarianism and nativism.

Therefore, decisions about the languages that are included in or excluded from school curricula have a major and differential impact on individuals and carry major normative societal implications. The school language policies of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are typically reduced to nationalism. Language curricula are said to be state's means of creating the monolingual nationals required to prove its legitimacy. However, other explanations have also been advanced. They may rely on actors' interests, on actors' ideas, or on the influence of social, economic, or power structures on the political process.\n\nSo far, these different theories have always been considered in isolation, and studies seldom discuss whether the theory they advance retains its explanatory power when alternative explanations are also considered. This project aims to fill this gap. It involves comparing the different theories developed to explain school language policies and testing the causal mechanisms that they propose on an ideal pathway case: officially multilingual and federalist Switzerland. The study therefore asks: What are the underlying reasons for why languages were included in or excluded from the curricula of Swiss state-led schools from the 1830s to the 1980s?\n\nTheoretically, the thesis refines our understanding of school language policies’ underlying causes and mechanisms, and of the relationship among state-building, nation-building, and education policy more generally. Methodologically, by drawing on recent advance historically informed qualitative case studies and, namely, process tracing, the project develops an original tool for a more theoretically informed and multidisciplinary approach to education policy. Empirically, the project takes advantage of the analytical leverage offered by the case of Switzerland and thereby develops the first systematic historical reconstruction of the modern Swiss state’s school language policies.","tags":null,"title":"Explaining Swiss Language Education Policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anja Giudici","Karin Manz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"0e272d5c575d33294ef922d34f7143d2","permalink":"https://anjagiudici.github.io/publication/giudicimanz2018_gender/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giudicimanz2018_gender/","section":"publication","summary":"The article is in German.\n\n\nLange definierten Curricula die Lernzeiten von Mädchen und Knaben unter- schiedlich.

Das während des 1. Weltkrieges von der freisinnigen Elite entwickelte Programm sollte durch vermehrten Unterricht in Schweizergeschichte, Politischer Bildung und in den Schweizer Landessprachen die drohende Spaltung der Schweiz verhindern. Das Programm scheiterte jedoch aufgrund der Opposition von katholisch-konservativer, sozialistischer und bildungsföderalistischer Seite.

This programme, developed by the liberal elite during World War One, aimed at preventing Switzerland’s disintegration through a stronger focus on Swiss history, political education, and the teaching of Swiss languages in curricula. However, the programme failed because of the opposition exerted by the Catholic-Conservative Party and the Social-Democratic Party as well as by the cantons’ representatives. We frame this case as a forced cultural transfer and outline how this concept can add new perspectives to the research on cultural transfers, which up to now focused on voluntary, transnational processes of adaptation and appropriation, steered by the beneficiaries of such exchanges. Our take permits to consider institutional factors as well as deliberate and failed exchange processes.*","tags":null,"title":"Das Programm zur Nationalen Erziehung (1914–1924) oder wie ein forcierter Kulturtransfer politisch scheitert","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This series of studies and publications are the result of my collaborations with several political scientists, educationalists, and linguists.

Seit 1999 muss die Bundesversammlung darauf Rücksicht nehmen, dass verschiedene Sprachen und Regionen der Schweiz im Bundesrat angemessen vertreten sind (Art. 175 Ab. 4 BV). Zusätzlich achtet das Parlament darauf, dass ein gewisser Parteiproporz und die Präsenz beider Geschlechter in der Regierung gesichert werden. Früher war auch die konfessionelle Zugehörigkeit der Bundesratsmitglieder ein Thema und bis 1999 durfte maximal eine Person pro Kanton amtieren. Mittels einer Vollerhebung relevanter Merkmale aller Mitglieder des Bundesrates seit 1848 und einer, verglichen mit bisherigen Studien, differenzierteren Auswertungsmethode legen wir einen präzisen Überblick über die Vertretung der Parteien, Regionen, Sprachen und Religionen in der Regierung vor.

Mill nel suo celeberrimo *Of Nationality, as Connected to Representative Government* (1861). Ai suoi occhi, la presenza di più gruppi linguistici avrebbe creato diffidenza e disparità di trattamento fra le diverse componenti statali e reso impossibile la formazione di una sfera pubblica, cioè dello spazio deliberativo necessario a uno Stato per dirsi veramente democratico. Queste considerazioni di Mill si scontrano con l’immagine del caso svizzero, che viene spesso considerato “caso paradigmatico” di riuscita conciliazione tra regime democratico e convivenza di più gruppi linguistici3. Come già implicato da Mill, il concetto di Stato-nazione, e quindi la costruzione sociale che ha dominato e strutturato la politica dal XIX secolo in avanti, è strettamente legato alla presenza di uno spazio culturalmente e linguisticamente omogeneo, inteso a garantire il suo successo democratico, economico e militare. L’affermazione di questo concetto in gran parte dell’Europa dal XVIII secolo e la sua radicalizzazione dal 1870 in poi si è quindi ripercossa anche su quello che è stato definito il mezzo più importante di politica culturale e linguistica: la scuola pubblica. Ma se l’affermazione dello Stato-nazione monolingue ha avuto come risultato la nascita di sistemi e programmi scolastici atti a creare la popolazione linguisticamente omogenea che gli si confaceva, allora dobbiamo chiederci se e come si sia invece ripercossa la creazione di uno Stato federale multilingue sulla politica linguistica scolastica.
